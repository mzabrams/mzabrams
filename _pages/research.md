## Research Accomplishments
I study head injuries across multiple domains, with an interest in sex differences in injury outcomes. Head and brain injuries are a significant public health issue that affect individuals worldwide and encompass a wide range of injury types and severities. Traumatic head and brain injuries are a common injury observed in sports and motor vehicle crashes (MVC). Despite decades of dedicated research, the fundamental underlying causes of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) remain poorly understood. My research interests revolve around understanding the environments where TBI occurs.

My dissertation research focused on four core projects: 

1. Sex differences in motor vehicle crash (MVC) outcomes
2. Biofidelity of instrumented mouthguards for head impact monitoring
3. Epidemiology of head impact exposure in Muay Thai
4. Assessment of common injury metrics during non-injurious head impacts

### **Sex Differences in Motor Vehicle Crashes**
Motor vehicle accidents are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, particularly for individuals under the age of 35. While advanced vehicle safety technologies have successfully reduced fatality rates in new vehicles, these advancements have not been equitable. My research focused on examining sex differences in vehicle safety outcomes, and determined that young females, between the ages of 20-40, are at increased risk of death, specifically due to head injuries, compared to males. 

This research was recognized by the International Research Council on the Biomechanics of Injury in 2022 with the Gundolf Beier Award, highlighting research with a high potential to influence the field of traffic safety.

### **Biofidelity of Instrumented Mouthguards**
Instrumented mouthguard systems (iMGs) such as the Prevent Biometrics iMG are increasingly prevalent in field studies of head impact exposure, particularly in martial arts studies. As part of a collaborative study between Duke University and Wayne State University, two instrumented mouthguard systems were evaluated through helmeted cadaver head impacts, as well as direct mandible impacts with a boxing-style impactor. My research focused on examining the results from the helmeted impacts, and found that commonly used validation procedures focused on anthropomorphic test device (ATD) testing are insufficient for fully assessing the biofidelity of wearable kinematic measurement systems.

### **Epidemiology of Head Impact Exposure in Muay Thai**
Sports-related head injuries are a major public health issue, and account for a large percentage of TBI-related emergency department visits annually. While much of the concussion literature and public discourse has historically focused on American football, concussions are not solely a football-related issue. Martial Arts are
